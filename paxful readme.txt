# Project Name Readme

This project is built using the Django web framework for Python. The README provides instructions on setting up and running the project using the command prompt.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python:** Ensure Python 3.x is installed. You can verify this by running:
  ```
  python --version
  ```
  or
  ```
  python3 --version
  ```
  If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **pip:** Python package installer, usually installed with Python. Check if pip is installed by running:
  ```
  pip --version
  ```
  If not installed, follow the installation instructions from [pip.pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

- **Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):** It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Install `virtualenv` using pip:
  ```
  pip install virtualenv
  ```

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Project:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Or download the project as a ZIP archive and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd project-directory
   ```
   Replace `project-directory` with the actual name of your project directory.

## Setting Up Virtual Environment (Optional)

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   ```
   Replace `venv` with your preferred name for the virtual environment.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - **On Windows:**
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS and Linux:**
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

## Install Dependencies

Ensure you are in the project directory where `requirements.txt` is located.

1. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Development Server

1. **Apply Migrations:**
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   This will start the Django development server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

3. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to view your Django application.

## Additional Notes

- **manage.py:** Use `manage.py` for various tasks such as managing database migrations, creating superusers, and running tests. Explore available commands by running:
  ```
  python manage.py help
  ```

- **Debugging:** If you encounter any issues during setup or while running the server, check the Django documentation at [docs.djangoproject.com](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/) or search online forums for solutions.

- **Contributing:** If you plan to contribute to this project, fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
